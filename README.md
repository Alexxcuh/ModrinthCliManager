**Modrinth Cli Manager** is a simple and easy to use manager that lets you quickly update all of your mods, and also lets you search for other mods.

## !!! NOTICE !!!
**Upon usage the script will delete all .jar files in the mods directory and then replace them with the mods in the settings.yaml file, it's not recursive, thus you can put a mod you dont want it to delete in a subfolder in the mods folder.**
Also, don't confuse the mod name with the project id, they are 2 separate things, for example, ``https://modrinth.com/mod/gamma-utils``, the mod name is ``Gamma Utils (Fullbright)``, and the project id is ``gamma-utils``, don't confuse one another or the script won't work correctly.  
## Usage
you put into the mods.txt file the project ids of the modrinth mods, you can find them in the link of the site, eg: ``https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium/``, the project id would be ``lithium``

**the mods.txt file must be in the same directory as the script or it wont work.**
